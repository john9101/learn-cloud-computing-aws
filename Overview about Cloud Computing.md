# Overview about Cloud Computing


## What is Cloud Computing?
 
 - Cloud Computing is the **on-demand delivery** of computer power, database storage, applications, and other IT resource
 - Through a cloud service platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
 - You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
 - You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
 - Simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a set of application services
 - Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

 - **On-demand self-service**
   > Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
 - **Broad network access**
	> Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
 -  **Multi-tenancy and resource pooling**
	 > <ul><li>Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy</li><li>Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources</li></ul>
 - **Rapid elasticity and scalability**
	 > <ul><li>Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose of resources when needed</li><li>Quickly and easily scale based on demand</li></ul>
 - **Measured service**
	 > Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- **Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)**
	> <ul><li>Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware</li><li>Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)</li></ul>
- **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
	> Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- **Stop guessing capacity**
	>  Scale based on actual measured usage
- **Increase speed and agility**
- **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
- **Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure**

## Problems solved by the Cloud

- **Flexibility:** change resource types when needed 
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** pay as you go, for what you use 
- **Scalability:** accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes 
- **Elasticity:** ability to scale out and scale-in when needed 
- **High-availability and fault-tolerance:** build across data centers 
- **Agility:** rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

## Types of Cloud Computing

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
	> <ul><li>Provide building blocks for cloud IT</li><li>Provides networking, computers, data storage space</li><li>Highest level of flexibility</li><li>Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT</li></ul>
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
	> <ul><li>Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure</li><li>Focus on the deployment and management of your applications</li></ul>
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
	> Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

## Example of Cloud Computing Types

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
	> <ul><li>Amazon EC2 (on AWS)</li><li>GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode</li></ul>
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
	> <ul><li>Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)</li><li>Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)</li></ul>
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
